## Libraries

library(MouseGastrulationData)
library(scater)

library(scuttle)

## Data selection 

### Selection of cells from appropriate developmental stages - E8.0, E8.25 and E.85.
### The data from developmental stages E8.0, E8.25 and E8.5 was stored in a AtlasSampleMetadata object.

AtlasSampleMetadata <- subset(AtlasSampleMetadata, stage %in% c("E8.0", "E8.25", "E8.5"))

### Selection of processed cells, from all samples from above stages.
### Processed cells from all samples of above stages are included in the sce object.

sce <- EmbryoAtlasData(type = "processed", samples = AtlasSampleMetadata$sample)

### The doublet and Stripped nuclei exclusion  
### Here I perform removal of doublets (two cells in a droplet) and stripped nuclei cells (cell nuclei without cytoplasm) from the experiment object.

nan <- sce$doublet | sce$stripped
ind <- !nan
sce <- sce[, ind]

## Sub-sampling  
## selection of random 500 cells from each sample - all developmental stages stages.

set.seed(0011011101)
ind <- split(sce$cell, sce$sample)
ind <- lapply(ind, sample, size = 500)
ind <- unlist(ind)
sce <- sce[, ind]

## Gene selection
## Genes, which do not have any counts are removed.

mat <- counts(sce)
ind <- rowSums(mat) > 0
sce <- sce[ind, ]

## Log transformation 
## Data normalization - LogNorm calculation for the counts assay in entire sce object. Identification of 1000 top high variability genes (hvgs) for each sample separately and their storage in HVG for additional analysis.

set.seed(1001110100)
sce <- logNormCounts(sce)
dec <- modelGeneVarByPoisson(sce, block = sce$sample)
hvg1 <- getTopHVGs(dec, n = 1000)
rowSubset(sce, "HVG") <- hvg1
